Example of a code block 
# Formular: Interest= (principle * rate *time)
principle=120000     #shillings
rate=26              # percent
time= 7              # years
Interest= (principle * rate *time)
print(Simple interest:"interest)

My little brother I advice you with a sincere heart that its better you study to your level best so as you can avoid the great challanges that people out here are going through all because of there mischievous nature and not following the simple instructions given byt the teachers and consiquently end up crying as they such for the jobes they once dreamt of. This leaves them unable to cope up with the tough economy in the country at large.
